		<p>Hello. My name is Ryan Brockley. This is my first website built using <strong>HTML5, CSS3</strong> and <strong>Javascript</strong>. I am a fully skilled Welder, Fabricator. Ive enjoyed my years as an engineer but i felt like it was time for a change. Always using a computer from being young and the fact i have a very keen interest in technology, i felt that a career in <em>Web Development</em> was the way i had decided to go. I started my new journey by searching the internet for courses and Bootcamps which i could take part in. I soon descovered a whole new world and community i never knew existed. I started out doing <strong>FREE ONLINE COURSES</strong> and soon developed an interest in the <em>three</em> main languages. These are <span class="redtext">HTML5</span>. <span class="bluetext">CSS3</span>. <span class="yellowtext">Javascript</span></p>
