	<h1><strong>Hello and welcome to my first webpage!</strong></h1>
	<img class="mainimg" src="IMG_20180207_192717.jpg" alt="Picture of Ryan Brockley">

	<p class="mainpara">Hello, my name is <strong>Ryan Brockley</strong> and this is my first webpage constructed
		using <em> HTML5</em>,<em> CSS3</em>,<em> and Javascript</em>. I hope to share my experience and resources so far in a bid to show just how fun and rewarding Coding can be. Im 33 years old and im a fully skilled welder, fabrictor. Ive enjoyed my years as an engineer but i felt like i wanted a change in career. I first discovered the different coding languages from a friend. He currently owns his own business as a web developer. Already being computer and internet literate, i felt it was a no brainer to learn these skills and one day make my own career as a developer. This is when i discovered the basic three main languages. With this page i hope to outline some of my progress so far. </p>
		<h2>The main three languages!</h2>

		<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/"><img class="logos" src="css31.JPG" alt="css3 logo"></a>
		<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/"><img class="logos" src="javascript1.JPG" alt="javascript logo"></a>
		<h2 class="htmlh2">HTML5</h2>
		<p class="mainpara">HTML stands for <em>Hyper Text Markup Language</em>. It was originally designed by a man called Tim Berners-Lee to send research documents from one university to another using what we know now as, The World Wide web.</p>
		<h2 class="cssh2">CSS3</h2>
		<p class="mainpara">Css3 is mainly used to style the HTML5 documents. Adding colour texture and style to a webpage.</p>
		<h2 class="javascripth2">Javascript</h2>
		<p class="mainpara">Javascript is what gets everthing moving. This could be called the brain of a website as it is used for interaction and behaviour on a website.</p>
		<h2>Push my buttons!</h2>

			<h2>The courses and resources that ive used......</h2>
			<div class="mainpara">
				<p><strong>Sololearn</strong>- I found this a really useful source to learn to code. Sololearn is available for most smartphones which i found really useful as an <em>On The Go Learning Tool</em>. They also have a desktop based site which makes the whole experience customisable to your needs.</p>
				<br>
				<p><strong>Udemy</strong>- This is a browser based website ive used mostly on my home pc. I am currently doing a <strong>Fullstack Bootcamp Course</strong> run and designed by <em>Colt Steele</em>. This is a very instructive and interactive course. Up to now it's the best course i've found so far for learning these three basic languages. </p>
				<br>
				<p><strong>Pluralsight</strong>- This is a browser based website ive used mostly on my home pc. I am currently doing a <strong>HTML From Scratch</strong> course. I've found that Pluralsight is one of the more advanced sites to use and would recommend looking eleswhere if you have no coding knowledge what so ever.</p>
				<p><strong>Codeacadamy</strong>- This is another browser based learning course which is open to everyone. Even the complete novice like me. This is definately a good place to start if your a complete noob!</p>
