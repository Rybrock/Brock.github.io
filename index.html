      <strong>My Journey Into Coding!</strong>
    </h1>
  </section>



  <p class="mainpara">Hello. My name is
    <strong>Ryan Brockley</strong>. This is my first
    <strong>Webpage</strong> built using skills i've recently obtained. I am a fully skilled Welder,Fabricator by trade. I've loved
    my years as an engineer but i felt like it was time for a change. I started my journey looking for courses i could do
    at home from my own laptop. I soon discovered a whole new world and community i never knew existed! By visiting this
    webpage i hope to outline just how fun and rewarding learning to code can be. I've enrolled in quite a few
    <strong>online courses</strong> as there are a lot out there. I've included some
    <em>links</em> on the page that hopefully will lead to your first step into this wonderful community.</p>

      </strong>,

      <strong>
