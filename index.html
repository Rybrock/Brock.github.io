	<p class="mainpara">Hello. My name is Ryan Brockley. This is my first <strong>Webpage</strong> built using skills i've recently obtained. I am a fully skilled Welder,Fabricator by trade. I've loved my years as an engineer but i felt like it was time for a change. I started my journey looking for courses i could do at home from my own laptop. I soon discovered a whole new world and community i never knew existed!</p>
