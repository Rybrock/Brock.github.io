	   <p class="mainpara">Hello, my name is <strong>Ryan Brockley</strong> and this is my first webpage constructed
		using <em> HTML5</em>,<em> CSS3</em>,<em> and Javascript</em>. I hope to share my experience and resources so far in a bid to show just how fun and rewarding Coding can be. I hope to use what i've learned so far and implement that on this site. I am 33 years old and i'm a fully skilled welder, fabrictor. Ive enjoyed my years as an engineer but i felt like i wanted a change in career. I first discovered the different coding languages from a friend. He currently owns his own business as a web developer. Already being computer and internet literate, i felt it was a no brainer to learn these skills and one day make my own career as a developer. This is when i discovered the three main basic languages. With this page i hope to outline some of my progress so far. </p>

	<h2>The courses and resources that ive used......</h2>
	<div class="mainpara">
		<p><strong>Sololearn</strong>- I found this a really useful source to learn to code. Sololearn is available for most smartphones which i found really useful as an <em>On The Go Learning Tool</em>. They also have a desktop based site which makes the whole experience customisable to your needs.</p>
		<br>
		<p><strong>Udemy</strong>- This is a browser based website ive used mostly on my home pc. I am currently doing a <strong>Fullstack Bootcamp Course</strong> run and designed by <em>Colt Steele</em>. This is a very instructive and interactive course. Up to now it's the best course i've found so far for learning these three basic languages. </p>
		<br>
		<p><strong>Pluralsight</strong>- This is a browser based website ive used mostly on my home pc. I am currently doing a <strong>HTML From Scratch</strong> course. I've found that Pluralsight is one of the more advanced sites to use and would recommend looking eleswhere if you have no coding knowledge what so ever.</p>
		<p><strong>Codeacadamy</strong>- This is another browser based learning course which is open to everyone. Even the complete novice like me. This is definately a good place to start if your a complete noob!</p>

	<h2>Achievments so far.....</h2>
	<p>By completing online courses ive managed to obtain these certificates of my progress so far. This was done on a Smartphone using an <strong>Android</strong> app called <strong>Sololearn</strong>. I hope to achive more certifictes and skills from the other courses outlined in this page. As i said before, coding is very rewarding.</p>
